                <h2>About Myself</h2>
                
                <p>Video games started it all. 
                    From playing to creating my 
                    own levels to play on computer 
                    and share with others. Computer science 
                    and Q Basic in high school got me 
                    hooked on coding even beyond games. 
                    Even completing a Video Game Design 
                    course I wanted learn code. In my mind 
                    the sky is the limit as long as I am 
                    willing to learn.</p>

                <p>Learning on my down time, having 
                guidance available and a project 
                focused approach appeal to me 
                greatly. Having these will allow 
                me to better use my time since 
                there is someone helping push me 
                along so I can best improve and 
                know what to focus on.   </p>
